#  Maps Functions and Site

Code to transform any cylindrical projection to any other, using any rotation of the globe.

Currently just has I/O for Gall-Peters and Plate-Carre projections.

Still needs:
  *  function to produce rotation given two locations of interest
  *  function to produce animations


This code produces maps like this one:

## Other Examples

These are made with night light maps.
