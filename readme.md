# Map Projections

This repo contains a few notebooks and some script to generate interesting maps.  The maps are all standard projections, but with new orientations.

I would like to
  * add a simple example gif rotating the globe a bit
  * clean up the stuff in projections.py - it's VERY old (5+ years) and is pretty gross
  * also clean up the Blaueu notebook 
  * unify the Blaueu stuff with the other stuff so I can show the Blaueu map with a cylindrical projection

#  Examples

This code produces maps like these:
