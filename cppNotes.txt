In order to start working with C++, you need to do a lot of things.

1st - download the newest version of Xcode.  You need this becuase it has compilers for C and C++ (called "gcc" or "g++").  You can use the app store to get Xcode, it's free.  Once you have it, go to preferences and then the Downloads tab.  Make sure the 'command line tools' are installed.  That gets you g++ and gcc, so you don't have to compile things within Xcode.

2nd - We're going to want to use the Boost libraries, which extend C++, giving us useful things like nice arrays and some more math functions.  Any time you choose a library to build into your program, you need to make sure it is dependable.  Boost is one of the most popular libraries, and is supported by a large community.  The newest version of C++ integrated a lot of stuff from Boost.  From looking around, it seems Boost is the best choice (in terms of support/user base) for our purposes.  Another good library is GSL (Gnu Science Libraries), which we might pick up later.

    Download boost.  Also download macports.  Macports rules.  It is a utility that mimics apt-get, which is a unix tool for installing software.  It is super super useful, and will download and install dependencies for you.  Macports rules.  To install boost with macports, use http://sophie-notes.blogspot.com/2010/04/install-boost-on-mac-snow-leopard-using.html.  I have a Lion system and this worked fine.  At some point you might have macports tell you that your dependencies list is old - if it does, run 
    $ port -d selfupdate
If this doesn't work, use
    $ sudo port -d selfupdate
Then just follow the rest of the instructions on that site.  The installation could take awhile, because it will go through a lot of dependencies.  

3rd - Run some test functions.  Make a helloWorld.cpp, built it with 
    $ g++ -Wall -I/opt/local/include -o hiWorld helloWorld.cpp
The -Wall sets warnings "W" to all, and the '-o hiWorld' sets the object you create to be called hiWorld, which you can then run in the terminal.  For your hello world or math test program, you won't really need the -Wall warnings, but it's a good habbit.  The -I/opt... bit is necessary to tell g++ where macports put all the boost files.  Check out http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2727031/makefile-can-not-find-boost-libraries-installed-by-macports for why.  You should be able to find code for hello world online - there's one on cplusplus.com that explains every line in good detail.  It's here: http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/program_structure/



4th - Run a test of a boost library function to make sure it's working.  I recommend this one: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_51_0/libs/multi_array/doc/user.html
